                                After the successful development of the environment action plan for the Town of Florenceville-Bristol, I was invited to continue working with the Town to investigate and research potential programs available to the local community for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. 
                                I acted as the expert, being the contact person, tasked to disseminate information to the public through reports, presentations, and direct question and answering. 
                                This plan is be used by the public, local businesses, and government to explore potential community engagements and funding sources to increase sustainability in Florenceville-Bristol.

                                I developed and led a project proposal to create a climate action plan for the Town of Florenceville-Bristol, NB. 
                                This project proposal was successfully approved for $15,000. 
                                I managed a team of 2 where we carried out an assessment on avenues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the local community. 
                                I better understood the building energy efficiency of each building in the Town. I was the lead contact and liaised closely with community stakeholders to understand their perspectives and determine how to best implement the findings. 
                                I held community engagements to receive stakeholder perspective and feedback on the proposed changes and actions. Continuous iterations were implemented as new requirements arose. Prototyping necessary interfaces and software was critical for the successful tracking of GHG emissions. 
                                A final report was produced, with recommendations for the local action plan for the Town of Florenceville-Bristol. 
                                The town planned for a reduction of 21% of 2017 CO2 emissions by 2025.

                            While at UNB, I completed my Master of Science in Engineering in 3D city modelling. I was able to navigate through complex topics and ideas. 
                            Investigate and develop my programming skills, working in Python, R, and JavaScript.

                            I love working on experimental projects. 
                            I love even more when it reaches production level! Currently, I research where we will be growing food across Canada in the year 2070. 
                            Imagine what foods exist today that didn’t exist 20 years ago (hint, Canola is a Canadian invention). 
                            I want to take this sense of curiously to Tesla and further expand on the greatness that has been accomplished.
